Abstract:

> Drinking water samples taken from cafeteria sinks and water fountains in each of the 76 schools in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools (WSFCS) district were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) to determine As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb, Se and Tl. All samples from currently active schools tested below the maximum contaminant level (MCL) set for each element. Model-based clustering was employed to identify schools more prone to drinking water contamination. This multivariate approach may be used in a prevention program that can be tailored to specific school districts, with each school tested at a frequency compatible with its contamination risk level. Water flow stagnation during the summer break results in higher elemental concentrations in drinking water, but a simple 5 - 60 min flushing procedure significantly reduces the contamination levels.
